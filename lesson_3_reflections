-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing and collaborating with other people. 

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be some other people that make some changes on your repository, that you might choose
not to add to your project. So in this case you can choose which changes to pull nad which not.
